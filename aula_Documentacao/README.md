To start your RStudio session (and read your R and Rmd files), click on "new", and at the bottom will be RStudio Session. Click that and you're ready to go!

Or use a R Kernel to read R python notebook (ipynb files).

# RStudio in Binder using a Dockerfile

## Binder

This is a proof-of-concept to deploy a Binder that exposes the RStudio UI instead of a Jupyter Notebook. It also installs several packages from the tidyverse, and includes a demo script to show off functionality.

Special thanks to Ryan Lovett (@ryanlovett) for figuring out RStudio support with JupyterHub
