# RStudio in Binder using a Dockerfile

## Binder

This is a proof-of-concept to deploy a Binder that exposes the RStudio UI instead of a Jupyter Notebook. It also installs several packages from the tidyverse, and includes a demo script to show off functionality.

To start your RStudio session, click on "new", and at the bottom will be RStudio Session. Click that and you're ready to go!

Special thanks to Ryan Lovett (@ryanlovett) for figuring out RStudio support with JupyterHub
